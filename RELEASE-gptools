GPSUITE
0.2.3
  - wasn't writing headers to logs when --logname used

GETPUT
0.2.5
  - last patch broke --insecure

0.2.4
  - new switch --ropts controls how ranges are applied to GETs
  - extended functionality of --latexc to optionally include
    which type of operation to apply test to
  - if a the authentication token expirer during a single get/put/del,
    one must get a new token and then reconnect (was connecting with
    old token which had already expired!).  Also, get a new token
    at the start of every put/get/del since the reconnect varliable
    in only local to the thread that got it and easier to just
    get a new connection every time

0.2.3
  - new switches for getput
    --echo  will simply echo the command used to invoke getput which
      can be handle for archiving test results
    --range will now do get-by-range using the specified string
  - remove documentation from man page on random processing as well
    as using flat hierarchies for creating/accessing object with
    random names as it is felt those same objectives can be achieved
    via --objopts r and --objseed

0.2.2
  - added hostname to gpsuite log file output AND name
  - added --objseed to getput
  - added r option to objects which causes random onames to be geneated
    by sha512 digests of the object number

0.2.1   Apr 07, 2016
  - added etag checking to both put and get operations in getput
  - recognize MD5 Errors in gpmulti
  - no changes to gpsuite
  - enhanced --header funtionality to append object number to tag
    and to add modifier to see a fixed width for formatting it
  - added number of retries to each line of getput output, noting non-0
    should be pretty rare
  - honor OS_ENDPOINT_TYPE

0.2.0   Apr 04, 2016
  - added --scheme to gpmulti
  - changed default --ctype to byproc in both getput and gpmulti
  - no changes to gpsuite, but bumped version
  - get GET transID from response headers dictionary like everywhere
    else so we can pass it to api_error
  - don't sleep every 10 seconds before deleting a container, sleep only
    after a failure
  - calling delcont() at wrong indentation level do wasn't deleting all

0.1.9	Dec 02, 2015
  - added --headers to getput allow passing debugging code to swift daemons
  - gpsuite will now ignore any lines in the credentials file not starting
    'export'

0.1.8   Sept 18, 2015
  - support V3 connection style

0.1.7   Aug 19, 2015
  - if gpmulti called with insecure also use --insecure with
    swift delete command
  - I just discovered the code for deleting containers (which
    is rarely used) was broken in several ways and had to be fixed

0.1.6	July 1, 2015
  - removed all references to --compress which is no longer needed
  - if was discovered that versions of urllib3 < 1.8 don't disable
    Nagel so getput goes through some hoops to see what version is
    installed because it can be in multiple locations
  - removed --nocompress from gpmulti
  - added --insecure and --venv to gpmulti
  - only change to gpsuite was to update version to 0.1.6
  - on api errors, report transid if available
  - reformatted api error message for more aligned reading

0.1.5   Jun 11, 2015
  - remove logic that always unset proxy env vars
  - if authenticate error, warn it might be caused by env proxy settings
  - on -d64, print proxy env vars if defined
  - if authentication token expired, reconnect but only up to 5 times

0.1.4	Jan 27, 2015
  - wrap disable_warnings in a try/except so can ignore errors
    that sometimes occur
  - new switch: -p to specify a storage policy, see manpage
    for details

0.1.3   Jan 23, 2014
  - added new switch, --scheme which allows you to override
    the url connection scheme as well as the port. applies to
    both authurl as well as preauthurl for talking directly
    to proxies
  - added new switch, --insecure
  - honor OA_CACERT if defined
  - update description of --sleeps in man page

0.1.2   Oct 14, 2014
  - added new switches:
    - retries will override the number of operation retries applied
      during normal operations, the default value of which is 5
    - sleeps allows one to sleep between tests, sets of tests and
      sets of processes
  - include number of tries in exception reporting as well as with
    -d32
  - clean up the drift detection code to make errors more explicit AND
    to check against clock on the machine running gpsuite
  - gpmulti should NOT try to run getput in ./
  - cleanup/clarification of --preauthtoken usage in manpage
  - when using flat hierarchies with getput, you MUST includle -n

0.1.1	Jun 24, 2014
  - discovered BOTH tenane_id and _name must exist in dictionary
    for V2 authentication to work

0.1.0   May 20, 2014
  - use setup.py to install
  - removed .py extensions

0.0.8   Feb 26, 2014
  - new getput/gpmulti switch: exclog
  - new conf file options for gpsuite
    --exclogs set to 1 to request getput to generate exception log
    --postargs specifies arguments to be included with --posttest script
  - added -p to posttest API as the logfile timestamp prefix to make it
    possible for script to find logfile when multiple ones in same dir
  - needed to optionally add tenant_name to opts if only it defined

0.0.7	Feb 18, 2014
  - Added support for using swiftclient's close() method which was not
    available with V1.5
  - expects transaction IDs to always be there now

0.0.6  Jan 7, 2013
  - sleep for 0.01 secs (without multiplying by instance) for container
    creation as including it had an unwanted multiplicative effect
  - include container names with -d32
  - added getting-started.txt to docs/

0.0.5  Dec 9, 2013
  - wasn't proerly loading tenant_id and tenant_name from creds file
  - the test for newAPI shouldn't just be based on the connection
    succeeding as I've seen it succeed and still no transIDs available
    so make sure 'response_dict' is an arg to put_object

0.0.4
  - looks like I messed up the syntax of the unexpected error printing
    around line 1650,  I really don't like pep8!

0.0.3
  - if any of cname, oname, creds or nodes are not specified in conf file
    use 'type' to generate default values.  consider us of  --dry to verify
  - new conf option: csv=1 will report all results in csv format

0.0.2
  - removed some extraneous debugging print statements from getput
  - added command line to log file
  - added a test inside the ping loop to measure clock drift and make
    sure within acceptable limits
  - remove py extentions after moving into place
  - added 'getting started doc', still needs gpsuite section

0.0.1    Oct 29, 2013
  - Initial Release
